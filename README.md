## Overview
### Description
Optimize & customize sending letters to politicians for activism at your fingertips.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Activism
- **Mobile:** Potential mobile features include the ability to take pictures of a printed letter to upload, the ability to upload your profile picture internally, and even the ability to use GPS functionality to determine the user's location without necessitating address input. 
- **Story:** Simplicity - Because of the Template Library and the ease of finding your politicians, users are inclined to send emails to contribute to advocacy.
Customizability - When large templates go around, politicians often use blockers to funnel all emails with a certain subject or body to a folder they don't look at. Customizability allows templates to be adjusted so all emails are actually read and thoroughly processed by staff.
- **Market:** The market is anyone interested in activism whatsoever. The inexperienced will benefit from the simplicity and the experienced will benefit from the uniqueness of the customizability.
- **Habit:** People can most definitely use this habitually. Once they recognize and experience the pure simplicity of the application, they will be able to form a habit out of reaching out to their politicians as often as possible. Addictive features can include infinite scrolling in the template library, minimalistic and beautiful UI, and potentially even rewards points to incline users to write more.
- **Scope:** The scope is very dependent. It would not be too challenging to build the client that sends the emails, but adding GPS, storing the template library, finding the right API for representatives, as well as adding on additional features could be challenging.
